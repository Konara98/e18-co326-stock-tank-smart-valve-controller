## Introduction

The stock tank smart valve controller is system which measure the liquid level of the tank and control the valve automatically according to the liquid level. Apart from this we can also manually control the valve.

## Problem Definition

Now a days there are ball valves to control the liquid level of the tanks. But the issue is we can't control the ball valve manually, bol valve may not have built-in smart connectivity or the ability to integrate with other devices or systems.

## Proposed Solution

The proposed solution is stock tank smart valve controller which can be used to control the valve atuomatically and manually. we can use smart device to control the valve without physically turning on/off the valve.

## High Level Solution Architecture
![Presentation1](https://github.com/cepdnaclk/e18-co326-stock-tank-smart-valve-controller/assets/73745793/dfc54724-5604-4d91-a57b-08fa9db1eb4f)


## Functionality
- Measuring the liquid level
- Identify the low liquid level
- Measuring the liquid temperature
- Turn on the valve and refill when the liquid level is low (Auto Mode)
- Turn off the valve automatically (Auto Mode)
- Turn on/off the valve using node-red dashboard (Manual Mode)
